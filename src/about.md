Not much here yet. Should probely write some interesting things about myself..<br/>
Anyway, one thing i can tell you is that Iam a huge nerd when it comes to things most normal people find pretty useless to know about.

Like that a day on mars has more or less hours from earth so NASA has to have to clocks, one for earth and one for mars time.
People must also work nights sometimes because of this "drift" as it might be daylight on mars and night on earth.
It's not like timezones wich are consistent. Each morning on mars will be lets say for example 1 hour later on earth each day
(this is just a example, i don't know the actual times).

And also the fact that if you land at a airport but do not go through passport control, You are not *actually* in that country.
